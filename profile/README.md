We Ship Software is a new service by Richard Rissanen and Jarrod Taylor focused on one thing: shipping software.

We've spent years working in the tech industry, iterating on product direction, project management, UX design, engineering, testing, marketing, and monetizing.

We’ve been lucky to work with some very talented people over the years at all kinds of agencies, startups, local shops, and big tech companies.

And we’ve built some great digital products and services that thousands of businesses and millions of consumers all around the world use every day.
